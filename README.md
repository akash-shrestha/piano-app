# Sample Project: Activity to Practice Piano Notes

This project provides a work-in-progress codebase for a web-based activity that assists in learning the piano.

The project has two parts:

- A server (written in Python using Flask) which manages the data for the application
- A client (written in ES6 using React) which displays the activity to the user in a web browser

## Getting up and running

### Without Docker

- Make sure python (version 3.5+) and node JS are installed on your system
- Create .env from .env.dist
- Install Flask into the python environment using `pip install flask`
- Navigate to the `client` folder and run `npm install`
- Once dependencies are installed, run `npm run build` to build the client project
- From the root folder, run `python server/run_server.py`
- Open http://localhost:5000/ to access the activity

### With Docker

```
Create .env from .env.dist
make build
make run
```

### Unfinished...

Intended direction for this project:

## Server

- notes are served in a sequence (at the moment the same note is served over and over again - perhaps this could make a tune?)
- keys pressed by the user are checked on the server, against the current note in the sequence
- the sequence of notes progresses when the user provides the correct key (until the end of the sequence)
- user is provided with summary data of correct/incorrect attempts within the provided sequence

## Client

- when a key is pressed, it is checked with the server (using this.props.checkAnswer in App.js) to determine if this is the matching key, and feedback is given to the user (in a user-friendly manner)
- the next note is then requested from the server, and displayed to the user
- a way for the activity to be completed, and a summary reported to the user's of their success (e.g. which keys were correct, and which they need to work on)

### Extension Ideas:

- add unit tests that provide good testing coverage
- add a Redux store to the project such that state is no longer stored within App.js
- user results are reported on a separate page which can also be navigated to as a single page app (SPA)
- add a way for users to share their results, or upload their own sequences/tunes to teach each other
